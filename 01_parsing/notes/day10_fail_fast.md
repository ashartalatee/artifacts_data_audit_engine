## Core Realization
Continuing on bad data is a decision.
Stopping early is also a decision — and often the correct one.

## Stop Conditions Implemented

- Schema violation
- Manual threshold breach

## Key Insight
Fail-fast is not fragility.
It is controlled discipline.

## Engine Maturity Signal
Pipeline can stop intentionally,
log the reason,
and leave data in a valid state.
